       " 'BACKGROUND Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, is an extremely rare disease in pregnancy. In this case, we report on COP diagnosed in recurrent pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics in pregnant woman. CASE SUMMARY A 35-year-old woman with no prior lung disease presented with concerns of chest pain with cough, sputum, dyspnea, and mild fever at 11 wk’ gestation. She was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; her symptoms improved temporarily. Four weeks after discharge, she was re-admitted with aggravated symptoms. Chest computed tomography demonstrated multifocal patchy airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacities at the basal segments of the right lower lobe, at the lateral basal segment of the lower lobe, and at the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed an increased lymphocyte count and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. Prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/d) was administered for 10 d after the second admission. Dyspnea improved after 3 d of steroid treatment and other symptoms improved on the 5th day of steroid administration. Post-delivery transbronchial lung biopsy further revealed the presence of granulation tissue with fibroblasts in small-bronchiole lumens. CONCLUSION This case suggests that it is important to differentiate COP from atypical pneumonia in the deteriorated condition despite antibiotic treatment.',\n",
       " 'Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare disease induced by autoantibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) and may be correlated with pregnancy, underlying malignancies, autoimmune diseases or drug administration. An 81-year-old man who presented with cough, expectoration, hemoptysis and multiple ecchymoses was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia by computed tomography scan. Respiratory symptoms were ameliorated after the application of antibiotics. Despite repeated infusion of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate, his prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) maintained in the 75-110-s range and ecchymoses were not ameliorated. Then, he was transferred to the department of hematology. Based on a prolonged APTT, decreased level of FVIII and presence of antibodies against FVIII, the patient was diagnosed with AHA. Then the patient was treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrates, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin, resulting in a complete remission of the bleeding, recovering the FVIII level and negativity for FVIII antibody titers. Here, we investigate this novel case retrospectively and review the relevant literature.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND\\nKlebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) can cause hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia, and urinary tract, wound, and blood infections. As there are few reports on K. pneumoniae infections in pregnancy and no treatment guidelines, diagnosis and treatment are difficult. The diagnosis and treatment require a bacterial culture to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, the condition is often exacerbated due to a lack of timely medication.\\n\\n\\nCASE DESCRIPTION\\nWe report a case of a pregnant woman with recurrent K. pneumoniae infection during pregnancy. The 40-year-old woman was admitted to hospital at 14 weeks gestation due to fever of unknown origin. She was treated with empiric antibiotics, and her fever resolved within 1 day. A blood culture showed K. pneumoniae infection. She was discharged after 11 days of treatment. However, 10 days later, she was re-hospitalized due to fever, and treated with cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium. Her fever resolved within 1 day. A blood culture again showed K. pneumoniae infection. On day 5, she experienced chills and a miscarriage. Cervical secretions showed K. pneumoniae, and a placental examination revealed chorioamnionitis. The treatment was changed to meropenem, and the patient recovered within 2 weeks.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nWhen a fever of unknown origin occurs during pregnancy, one should be wary of K. pneumoniae recurrence or secondary infection, and use sensitive antibiotics early. When K. pneumoniae is cultivated, the course of treatment must be sufficient, and the source of infection must be actively searched to prevent secondary infections, such as kidney cysts, liver cysts, lung cysts, and community infections. Finding the cause and taking appropriate treatment can prevent the occurrence of adverse pregnancy and childbirth history.',\n",
       " 'How Not to Miss Pregnancy Related Cardiomyopathy? \\n36 year old G5P4 African American female at 37 weeks presented with 2 week history of fatigue, shortness of breath on walking a few steps, and cough. Examination was significant for mild tachycardia at 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturations of 90%, and crackles across both lung fields. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.',\n",
       " 'Objective: To review the treatment of common bacterial and viral infections occurring in the pregnant patient. Data Sources: A literature search of MEDLINE was performed (inception to October 2018). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website was utilized for additional information. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant English-language studies and those conducted in humans were considered. Data Synthesis: β-Lactams alone or in combination are the preferred treatment for many common infections in pregnancy, such as urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), gonococcal infections, syphilis, chancroid, upper- and lower-respiratory-tract infections, certain gastrointestinal infections, Group B Streptococcus, listeriosis, and intrauterine inflammation or infection. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, are also utilized for the treatment of PID, chlamydia, gonococcal infections, chancroid, community-acquired pneumonia, and certain gastrointestinal infections. Other antibiotics or antivirals such as vancomycin, aminoglycosides, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, acyclovir, valacyclovir, and oseltamivir are included in the preferred therapy for some common bacterial and viral infections in pregnant patients as well. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review synthesizes available evidence of treatments of common infections in pregnancy and provides a concise summary to guide clinicians on empirical treatment during pregnancy. Conclusions: There are limited data on clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with common bacterial and viral infections. Empirical management decisions require balance of benefit and risk to both mother and infant. Although few clinical practice guidelines have quality evidence for strong recommendations in this population, clinicians should weigh antimicrobial dosing, pharmacokinetics, safety, and established effectiveness to optimize antimicrobial therapy in pregnancy.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease. We describe a case of CAPS during pregnancy requiring emergent VA ECMO cannulation. Description: A 20 year old G1P000 female at 27 weeks gestation presented to the emergency department with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient reported a history of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome, Factor V Leiden Deficiency, and Budd Chiari Syndrome. A CTPA was ordered. Imaging demonstrated bilateral ground glass nodular opacities and no pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted for suspected community acquired pneumonia and started on antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. On hospital day 5, the patient experienced worsening dyspnea and chest pain. A chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse, patchy infiltrates consistent with severe pulmonary edema. Fetal heart tracing at this time showed persistent late decelerations and the decision was made to proceed with emergent caesarian delivery. Immediately following delivery, the patient had worsening hemodynamic instability despite adequate hemostasis and minimal blood loss during surgery. A transesophageal echo (TEE) demonstrated global cardiac dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%. The patient was started on vasoactive medications with minimal improvement in cardiac output. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the decision was made to cannulate for VA ECMO. Aggressive treatment for CAPS was initiated including plasmaphoresis, IVIG, and high intensity steroids. The patient made gradual improvement and was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 8. She was transferred to the Neuro ICU where aggressive care continued. On hospital day 63, the patient was discharged to a rehab facility with a Modified Rankin Scale score of 1. Discussion: We successfully treated a rare case of CAPS precipitated by pregnancy that manifested with severe cardiomyopathy. While CAPS affects the heart in approximately 51% of cases, cardiogenic shock is a rare complication. The patient was successfully supported with VA ECMO while aggressive therapy for CAPS was initiated. The patient made considerable recovery and was discharged with no significant disability.']"
