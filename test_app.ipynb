      "Common treatments for pneumonia typically include the use of antibiotics to target bacterial infections, with the choice of antibiotic guided by the suspected or confirmed causative organism and its antimicrobial susceptibility. Supportive care measures, such as oxygen therapy for patients with respiratory distress or hypoxemia, and fluids to maintain hydration, are also commonly employed. In cases of severe pneumonia, particularly in intensive care settings, mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be required. For patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, careful selection and monitoring of antibiotics are crucial to address multidrug-resistant organisms. Additionally, managing underlying conditions and minimizing invasive procedures can help reduce complications.\n",

       "    'retrieved_contexts': ['Notably, for neurocritical care patients, strict glycemic control had no effect on patient mortality but increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (44). According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of optimal glycemic control in neurocritical care patients, a more conservative approach is the most appropriate (i.e., maintaining blood glucose levels of 110 mg/dL–180 mg/dL) (45). The variety of antibiotics used during the hospitalization of patients with HAP in the NICU was strongly associated with infections with MDROs. In NICU settings, patients with HAP commonly experience aspiration and impaired immune function. Moreover, the empirical use of antibiotics, which is routinely advocated for patients with HAP, inevitably leads to increases in both the variety and duration of antibiotic administration (46). Combined use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure on the patient’s microbial population, fostering the emergence of resistant strains (47). Therefore, stringent adherence to drug indications is paramount (48). Expediting the selection of appropriate antibiotics necessitates the prompt and accurate profiling of antibiotic susceptibility testing (49). Given the approximately 24 h turnaround time for standard antibiotic susceptibility testing following bacterial identification (50, 51), clinicians can turn to ML models to predict antimicrobial resistance in MDROs, which can shorten the delay in obtaining susceptibility testing results from microbiology laboratories (52). A longer ICU stay was associated with an increased risk of infections with MDROs in the NICU. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that ICU admission itself poses a significant risk for MDRO infections (53, 54). More importantly, patients in the NICU primarily include individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, acute cerebrovascular disorder, severe central nervous system infection, persistent seizure episodes, and emergent post-neurosurgical care (55). Patients with low immunity are more prone to infections with MDRO. To mitigate this risk of infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP, clinical staff should prioritize measures to expedite patient transfer to general wards, as these environments typically exhibit lower levels of bacterial resistance and invasiveness than ICUs do (56).',\n",
       "     'We also looked at co-infection status and antimicrobial resistance patterns, using the international definition of multi-drug resistance (MDR) as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories (30). We recorded patient comorbidities and risk factors including a history of MDR organisms, recent surgery, smoking, alcohol use, and intravenous drug use within 30 days of admission as well as prior antimicrobial use, prior hospitalization, and admission to a nursing home or other long-term acute care facility within 90 days of admission. Outcomes assessed included overall and ICU length of stay (LOS), pneumonia severity index (PSI) score on admission, in-hospital mortality, and need for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as well as supplemental oxygen during admission. Analyses for outcomes were completed by biological sex, sex and age, age within the same sex groups, and sex and primary admission diagnosis. For patients who were alive at discharge, charts were reviewed for the need for supplemental oxygen and ventilation on discharge. All data were obtained from the Epic Systems (Verona, Wisconsin) EMR retrospectively. Data collection included patient clinical data, laboratory and imaging results, and clinician notes where necessary for determining whether cultures met the inclusion criteria. All chart reviews were completed by trained medical staff. Data were stored using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data management platform (31, 32). Demographic and risk factor characteristics were assessed for differences by biological sex using the Pearson χ test. Continuous variables, including outcome data, were analyzed using a parametric Student t-test or non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, respectively. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was then performed for select outcomes using covariates including biological sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking within 30 days prior to admission, alcohol use within 30 days prior to admission, congestive heart failure status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status. For LOS and ICU length of stay (ICU LOS), outcomes were split into two groups depending on whether they were above or below the median value for each outcome. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.',\n",
       "     'The risk factors of infections with MDROs among critically ill patients have been widely studied. For example, the overuse of antibiotics, patient placement in beds in which the prior occupants were infected or colonized with MDROs, and prolonged ICU stays have been identified as important risk factors to the emergence of MDROs among ICU patients (10–14). While several studies have established risk prediction models for infections with MDROs tailored to ICU and NICU settings (12–15), the translation of these approaches into routine clinical practice for risk assessment is very limited (16, 17). This further emphasizes that hospital-level patient information is valuable to assess the risk of a patient suffering infection with MDROs, highlighting the need for the implementation of these methods for MDRO-mediated infection screening in hospitals. Moreover, a risk prediction model for the identification of infections with MDROs for NICU patients with HAP is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a prediction model for infections with MDROs among neurocritical care patients with HAP using multiple ML methods, including logistic regression, classification tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Moreover, by evaluating and comparing their performance, a visual nomogram was constructed based on the prediction model that performed with the best predictive effect. The ultimate goal was to provide clinical staff with a reliable and easy-to-use tool that can aid in the identification of patients at a higher risk of developing infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP. A retrospective analysis of patients who were discharged from the NICU was conducted for this study. The inclusion criteria were NICU patients with HAP presenting with an additional infection with at least one MDRO. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MDROs are defined as organisms exhibiting simultaneous resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials commonly used in clinical practice (18).',\n",

During the study period, MDROs were identified in 21.7% of NICU patients with HAP. Moreover, in our study, a visualized predictive model was constructed to identify the risk of infections with MDROs for NICU patients with HAP. Compared with other ML-based techniques, the model developed using the logistic regression approach showed a very good predictive effect, revealing that the length of NICU stay, number of antibiotics used, presence of diabetes, and carbamide value were predictors of infections with MDROs in patients with HAP admitted to the NICU. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated the top 3 detection rates in our study, aligning with recent research findings within NICU settings (12, 25, 26). However, in contrast to the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Report released by China in 2022 (which highlighted Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (30), Acinetobacter baumannii presented the highest detection rates in our analysis. A previous study indicated that MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii is being increasingly implicated in infections of critically ill patients (31). Acinetobacter baumannii possesses exceptional adherence capabilities, enabling it to colonize in sites such as catheters and ventilators, as well as in the conjunctiva, oral cavity, skin, and respiratory tract of hospitalized patients (32). NICU patients with HAP undergo numerous invasive procedures and have weakened immune systems, rendering them more susceptible to infections caused by MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii (33). The value of carbamide, which has been rarely reported in previous studies, was identified as an independent risk factor for infections with MDRO in our study.',\n",
       "     'The model demonstrated good calibration (Brier score 0.137). This model can provide clinicians with a tool for prevention and management of MDRO infections in NICU patients with HAP. Patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU) are at a high risk of developing multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections owing to complex conditions, critical illness, and frequent invasive procedures. However, studies focused on constructing prediction models for assessing the risk of MDRO infections in neurocritically ill patients with HAP are lacking at present. Therefore, this study aims to establish a reliable and easy-to-use nomogram for predicting the risk of MDRO infections in patients with HAP admitted to the NICU. Four easily accessed variables were included in the model, including length of NICU stay, number of antibiotics used, diabetes, and carbamide. This nomogram might help in the prediction and implementation of targeted interventions against infections with MDRO among patients with HAP in the NICU.\\n\\nFull Text: Neurocritical care patients face a substantial risk of nosocomial infections, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with nearly 40% of patients developing this condition (1–3). Patients with HAP require antibiotic therapy and invasive procedures (4) and are predisposed to developing infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (5, 6). In cases of infections with MDROs, the complexity of treatment and management for patients in neuro-intensive care units (NICUs) with HAP is significantly increased (7), resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, heightened economic burdens for patients and their families, and a heightened risk of in-hospital mortality (8, 9). Therefore, it may be beneficial to utilize machine learning (ML) models for prediction, identification, and application of targeted interventions to reduce the incidence of infections with MDRO among neurocritical care patients with HAP. The risk factors of infections with MDROs among critically ill patients have been widely studied.'],\n",

Adults with HIV infection are at greater risk of developing herpes zoster infection compared to those without HIV. Even with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, the risk remains higher compared to the general population. Immunocompromised individuals are at risk for severe VZV-related complications like fulminant and rapidly evolving pneumonia. As such, adjuvant therapies like IV immunoglobulins, where Varicella-specific immunoglobulins are not readily available, may be lifesaving in addition to acyclovir and other anti-viral medications. On a thorough literature search, no similar case reports or series were found to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG in patients with HIV infection/AIDS.

       "     'The persistence of this resistance phenotype, even in the absence of antibiotic pressure, underscores its potential clinical significance in the context of antibiotic resistance evolution. These results not only advance our fundamental understanding of resistance mechanisms but also offer valuable translational implications. The identified molecular signature serves as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions, including small molecule inhibitors and peptide-based therapies designed to restore RamR function or counteract the overactive efflux pumps. Furthermore, this work contributes to the rational design of next-generation antimicrobial agents through structure-based drug discovery approaches, aligning with contemporary strategies in antibiotic development. In future investigations, we aim to broaden our analysis by incorporating additional strains into the induction process, with a particular focus on clinically relevant isolates. Through extensive screening of these clinical strains, we seek to elucidate the prevalence and distribution of the identified mutations. These findings will not only inform the design of TaqMan probes for rapid detection but also facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to combat tigecycline resistance. In conclusion, this study elucidates a novel resistance mechanism mediated by ramR mutation and highlights its potential clinical relevance. By bridging fundamental research with translational applications, our work contributes to the ongoing global effort to address the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance, offering new avenues for therapeutic and diagnostic innovation.',\n",
       "     'Often, MRSA infections are treated with vancomycin; however, vancomycin-resistant MRSA isolates have been reported (48, 49). János et al. (49) reported vancomycin resistance and other MRSA first-line antibiotics imipenem and rifampicin in S. pseudintermedius canine isolates, a bacterium that is often misidentified as S. aureus in humans (50). Co-infection with S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius could lead to increased antibiotic resistance in MRSA through horizontal gene transfer with other Staphylococcus spp., which could further complicate MRSA treatment (49–52). Traditionally, genomic relatedness for S. aureus is found through multilocus sequence typing (MLST) or SPA typing. However, both MLST and SPA typing use a limited number of genes (seven for MLST and one for SPA typing) (53). The seven MLST genes range from 402 to 516 bp, giving a theoretical maximum of 3,198 SNP locations, but the actual polymorphic nucleotide sites are likely much smaller (54). While the spa gene has tandem repeats in the X region causing variation in gene size, Shakeri et al. (55) reported amplicon sizes ranging between 1,150 and 1,500 bp. By focusing on genome-wide SNPs, 71,721 SNP locations were compared to find relatedness, giving a deep comparison of genomes because this study’s SNP location counts are 22- and 48-fold larger compared to the maximum theoretically possible locations for MLST and SPA typing, respectively. Figure 3 shows the gene distribution of the reference strain (MRSA 400-0051) and which genes this study’s isolates had synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs (individual isolate’s gene and SNP statistics are found in Table 2). Using genome-wide SNPs, the S. aureus isolates in this study were found to have genomic relatedness to human, canine, feline, swine, and cattle isolates.',\n",

Without surfactant, PBMCs were 33.21% ± 3.31% PI-positive when exposed to supernatants versus 23.80% ± 2.75% PI-positive with 1% Infasurf (Fig. 2B). As with mouse and rat surfactants, growth in Infasurf did not impact bacterial viability (Fig. 2C). We originally expected that Infasurf would mirror natural surfactants in that higher concentrations would be able to protect immune cells in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, higher Infasurf concentrations no longer protected PMNs from membrane damage from S. aureus supernatants (Fig. 2A). Since a previous report of another commercially available surfactant, Surfactant TA observed changes in PMNs consistent with apoptosis (24), we investigated if higher concentrations of Infasurf impacted PMN plasma membrane damage. Incubating PMNs with higher concentrations of Infasurf (without any S. aureus supernatants) did not increase PI uptake in PMNs over controls (Fig. S1). Commercially available surfactant Infasurf protects human primary cells from S. aureus-mediated cytotoxicity. (A) S. aureus was grown to early stationary phase in TSB with varied dilutions of Infasurf and S. aureus supernatants were harvested, diluted to 1:50 final dilution, and incubated with human PMNs for 1 hour.

       "     'The cytoplasmic surface of TssL interacts with the baseplate complex, which serves as a nucleation point for the polymerization of the tail tube complex and its surrounding sheath [15]. The tail tube complex is a hollow cylinder of stacked rings of hexameric haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) capped by a trimer of valine glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) [16]. This trimer is ‘sharpened’ by a single copy of the zinc-binding proline-alanine-alanine-arginine (PAAR) protein, which likely facilitates penetration of the target cell membrane [17]. The tail tube complex is surrounded by a sheath comprised of the proteins TssB and TssC and the contraction of this sheath expels the tail tube complex and its associated effectors through the membrane apparatus into the target cell [18]. Many of the molecular events underlying these processes have been thoroughly characterized and have been meticulously reviewed elsewhere [4,19]. Several mechanisms of effector recruitment to the tail tube complex have been described. The best characterized is Hcp, which serves as a secreted chaperone that accommodates small effectors within its ~4 nm lumen, thus delivering these effectors into the target cell [20]. However, effectors that transit the T6SS by this mechanism cannot be larger than the diameter of the Hcp ring. Consequently, larger effectors instead associate with the outer surface of the tail tube complex for secretion. Some effectors exist as C-terminal domains of VgrG or PAAR proteins and are, therefore, evolutionarily fused to these tail tube proteins [16,21]. Others, however, are encoded by distinct genes and, therefore, must interact with the tail tube complex through non-covalent interactions. In some instances, these interactions require the activity of dedicated trafficking domains or accessory proteins, such as those belonging to the T6SS adaptor protein (Tap) or DUF2345 families [22–29].'],\n",

After the index admission, most patients were still symptomatic at discharge (moderate to critical National Early Warning Scores (NEWS)). Conclusion: The readmission rate after acute COVID-19 infection was 5.7%, aligning with rates reported internationally. The most frequent causes of readmission were persistent COVID-19 pneumonia, renal impairment, and urinary tract infections, while secondary bacterial pneumonia at readmission was rare. Readmission was associated with increased rates of ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation. The use of NEWS at discharge may serve as a useful criterion for determining readiness for discharge.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. Since then, countries worldwide have faced substantial health and economic consequences. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) predominantly affects the respiratory tract, with acute pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being among the most severe complications [2]. Both acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19 infection have been reported, including an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, bowel ischemia, severe ileus, acute ischemic stroke, acute liver and kidney injury, and arrhythmias, among many others [3–8]. The rate and causes of hospital readmission following an acute COVID-19 infection vary depending on the definition of readmission used, geographical location, patient characteristics, and the timing of the study relative to the pandemic's onset.\",\n",

       "     'This discrepancy may be attributable to population-specific characteristics, adherence to thromboprophylaxis protocols, or variations in reporting standards across studies. Our findings also indicated a notable increase in ICU admissions and invasive respiratory support requirements upon readmission. This may reflect the progression of COVID-19-related respiratory disease or an increased risk of associated complications, such as secondary pneumonia or heart failure. Reported ICU admission rates and invasive ventilation requirements in the literature vary significantly (7%–60%), reflecting the diverse clinical severity, patient demographics, and follow-up durations across different studies [21, 29, 30]. The observed mortality rate during readmissions was substantial (12.5%), with respiratory failure and sepsis being the most common underlying causes. These findings closely match other international reports, documenting postdischarge mortality ranging between 7.2% and 17.9% within 30 days after initial hospitalization [20]. The 1-year postdischarge all-cause mortality rate is estimated at 7.87%, with most deaths occurring within the first 30 days after discharge [31]. The relatively high mortality observed among our readmitted patients likely stems from multiple factors: underlying comorbidities, the severity of initial infection, and potentially premature discharges related to healthcare system constraints during the pandemic. The NEWS2 has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic as a sensitive tool for severity assessment and to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration [17, 32, 33]. Notably, a large proportion of patients discharged (83%) had moderate to critical NEWS2, raising concerns about the criteria used for discharge decision-making. Literature has identified low NEWS2 at discharge as protective against readmissions [34]; thus, higher scores observed in our patients warrant further investigation into discharge planning practices at our facility. While NEWS2 scoring systems are not currently standardized for discharge decision-making regarding COVID-19, this study highlights their potential utility. Furthermore, exploring additional biomarkers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at discharge could further enhance risk stratification and potentially reduce readmission rates through more targeted postdischarge follow-up or delayed discharge for high-risk patients [35].',\n",

Non-infected or colonized patients, patients with diseases that severely affected blood chemistry indexes (such as leukemia, severe renal failure, and severe liver failure), and patients with incomplete clinical and laboratory examination data were excluded. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (bioMérieux, France) was performed for the identification of bacteria. The VITEK-2 Compact (bioMérieux) automatic microbial identification instrument and its accompanying XN04 and N335 cards were used for the determination of drug sensitivity minimum inhibitory concentration values (21).

However, in some studies, male gender and age were included as significant predictors (14, 57, 58), whereas in our analysis, they were not found to be meaningful. This discrepancy may be attributed to the varying male-to-female ratios among patients admitted to different hospitals and departments in different regions. In our study, the proportion of male patients was relatively higher (66.25%). Additionally, patients in the NICU tended to be older, with all 791 included patients being over 51 years of age, which may limit comparability in the analysis. Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as an important predictor in several studies (14, 59); however, it was not found to be relevant in our research. This could be due to the generally high CRP levels in neurocritical patients (all above 10), with a CRP value greater than 10 indicating acute inflammation. Future studies, particularly multicenter trials with larger sample sizes, are needed to ensure the reliability of these findings. There are several limitations of our study. First, model development depended on evaluating variables that are routinely collected in primary care and ignored information from the perspective of hospital infection management, such as the implementation rate of hand hygiene and the frequency of pipeline disinfection. Second, this study was limited to a single hospital, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. We searched the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database (60) but found no data related to infections with MDROs in neurocritical patients with HAP; hence, no external validation was conducted. Third, a degree of internal bias is inevitable in this study due to its nature as a retrospective analysis. To avoid double counting, only the first isolate was recorded for each patient according to their ID number, which may lead to a potential risk of bias.',\n",
       "     'Notably, for neurocritical care patients, strict glycemic control had no effect on patient mortality but increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (44). According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of optimal glycemic control in neurocritical care patients, a more conservative approach is the most appropriate (i.e., maintaining blood glucose levels of 110 mg/dL–180 mg/dL) (45). The variety of antibiotics used during the hospitalization of patients with HAP in the NICU was strongly associated with infections with MDROs. In NICU settings, patients with HAP commonly experience aspiration and impaired immune function. Moreover, the empirical use of antibiotics, which is routinely advocated for patients with HAP, inevitably leads to increases in both the variety and duration of antibiotic administration (46). Combined use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure on the patient’s microbial population, fostering the emergence of resistant strains (47). Therefore, stringent adherence to drug indications is paramount (48). Expediting the selection of appropriate antibiotics necessitates the prompt and accurate profiling of antibiotic susceptibility testing (49). Given the approximately 24 h turnaround time for standard antibiotic susceptibility testing following bacterial identification (50, 51), clinicians can turn to ML models to predict antimicrobial resistance in MDROs, which can shorten the delay in obtaining susceptibility testing results from microbiology laboratories (52). A longer ICU stay was associated with an increased risk of infections with MDROs in the NICU. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that ICU admission itself poses a significant risk for MDRO infections (53, 54). More importantly, patients in the NICU primarily include individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, acute cerebrovascular disorder, severe central nervous system infection, persistent seizure episodes, and emergent post-neurosurgical care (55). Patients with low immunity are more prone to infections with MDRO. To mitigate this risk of infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP, clinical staff should prioritize measures to expedite patient transfer to general wards, as these environments typically exhibit lower levels of bacterial resistance and invasiveness than ICUs do (56).',\n",

For example, the overuse of antibiotics, patient placement in beds in which the prior occupants were infected or colonized with MDROs, and prolonged ICU stays have been identified as important risk factors to the emergence of MDROs among ICU patients (10–14). While several studies have established risk prediction models for infections with MDROs tailored to ICU and NICU settings (12–15), the translation of these approaches into routine clinical practice for risk assessment is very limited (16, 17). This further emphasizes that hospital-level patient information is valuable to assess the risk of a patient suffering infection with MDROs, highlighting the need for the implementation of these methods for MDRO-mediated infection screening in hospitals. Moreover, a risk prediction model for the identification of infections with MDROs for NICU patients with HAP is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a prediction model for infections with MDROs among neurocritical care patients with HAP using multiple ML methods, including logistic regression, classification tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Moreover, by evaluating and comparing their performance, a visual nomogram was constructed based on the prediction model that performed with the best predictive effect.

A previous study indicated that MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii is being increasingly implicated in infections of critically ill patients (31). Acinetobacter baumannii possesses exceptional adherence capabilities, enabling it to colonize in sites such as catheters and ventilators, as well as in the conjunctiva, oral cavity, skin, and respiratory tract of hospitalized patients (32). NICU patients with HAP undergo numerous invasive procedures and have weakened immune systems, rendering them more susceptible to infections caused by MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii (33).

MRSA infections are a major medical concern, causing a range of conditions from skin infections to invasive diseases including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, endocarditis, abscesses, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia (2, 22, 23). The MRSA economic burden in the United States is $478 million annually for a community-associated MRSA infection when outpatient, emergency room/hospital visits, treatment, mortality, and work absenteeism costs are considered (24). On the farm, MRSA can be costly also, with it being estimated it would cost $2.37–$2.58 billion to eradicate Livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA from pig housing units in Denmark (25). The economic burden from companion animal MRSA infections is not fully understood but could cost individual animal guardians less than $100 or thousands in veterinary costs, depending on whether antibiotic treatment or surgery is needed. This study hypothesized that MRSA isolated from therapy dogs and bulk tank milk is genomically related to MRSA associated with human infections derived from either hospital or community origins. Furthermore, genetic similarity to MRSA isolated from felines, bovines, swine, and canines was investigated.

Our findings also indicated a notable increase in ICU admissions and invasive respiratory support requirements upon readmission. This may reflect the progression of COVID-19-related respiratory disease or an increased risk of associated complications, such as secondary pneumonia or heart failure. Reported ICU admission rates and invasive ventilation requirements in the literature vary significantly (7%–60%), reflecting the diverse clinical severity, patient demographics, and follow-up durations across different studies [21, 29, 30]. The observed mortality rate during readmissions was substantial (12.5%), with respiratory failure and sepsis being the most common underlying causes. These findings closely match other international reports, documenting postdischarge mortality ranging between 7.2% and 17.9% within 30 days after initial hospitalization [20]. The 1-year postdischarge all-cause mortality rate is estimated at 7.87%, with most deaths occurring within the first 30 days after discharge [31]. The relatively high mortality observed among our readmitted patients likely stems from multiple factors: underlying comorbidities, the severity of initial infection, and potentially premature discharges related to healthcare system constraints during the pandemic. The NEWS2 has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic as a sensitive tool for severity assessment and to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration [17, 32, 33]. Notably, a large proportion of patients discharged (83%) had moderate to critical NEWS2, raising concerns about the criteria used for discharge decision-making. Literature has identified low NEWS2 at discharge as protective against readmissions [34]; thus, higher scores observed in our patients warrant further investigation into discharge planning practices at our facility. While NEWS2 scoring systems are not currently standardized for discharge decision-making regarding COVID-19, this study highlights their potential utility. Furthermore, exploring additional biomarkers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at discharge could further enhance risk stratification and potentially reduce readmission rates through more targeted postdischarge follow-up or delayed discharge for high-risk patients [35].',\n",

The most frequent causes of readmission were persistent COVID-19 pneumonia, renal impairment, and urinary tract infections, while secondary bacterial pneumonia at readmission was rare.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) predominantly affects the respiratory tract, with acute pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being among the most severe complications [2]. Both acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19 infection have been reported, including an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, bowel ischemia, severe ileus, acute ischemic stroke, acute liver and kidney injury, and arrhythmias, among many others [3–8]. The rate and causes of hospital readmission following an acute COVID-19 infection vary depending on the definition of readmission used, geographical location, patient characteristics, and the timing of the study relative to the pandemic's onset.\",\n",
       "     'The risk factors of infections with MDROs among critically ill patients have been widely studied. For example, the overuse of antibiotics, patient placement in beds in which the prior occupants were infected or colonized with MDROs, and prolonged ICU stays have been identified as important risk factors to the emergence of MDROs among ICU patients (10–14). While several studies have established risk prediction models for infections with MDROs tailored to ICU and NICU settings (12–15), the translation of these approaches into routine clinical practice for risk assessment is very limited (16, 17). This further emphasizes that hospital-level patient information is valuable to assess the risk of a patient suffering infection with MDROs, highlighting the need for the implementation of these methods for MDRO-mediated infection screening in hospitals. Moreover, a risk prediction model for the identification of infections with MDROs for NICU patients with HAP is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a prediction model for infections with MDROs among neurocritical care patients with HAP using multiple ML methods, including logistic regression, classification tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Moreover, by evaluating and comparing their performance, a visual nomogram was constructed based on the prediction model that performed with the best predictive effect. The ultimate goal was to provide clinical staff with a reliable and easy-to-use tool that can aid in the identification of patients at a higher risk of developing infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP. A retrospective analysis of patients who were discharged from the NICU was conducted for this study. The inclusion criteria were NICU patients with HAP presenting with an additional infection with at least one MDRO. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MDROs are defined as organisms exhibiting simultaneous resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials commonly used in clinical practice (18).',\n",

We collected the patients’ data, including: (i) demographics (age, sex, time to hospital admission, and Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score); (ii) comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease); (iii) laboratory examination findings (levels of albumin, WBCs, serum creatinine, and total protein within 48 h); and (iv) invasive procedures and the use of antibiotics. See Table S1 for more details regarding variable definitions. The data were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and an internal validation set (30%). Univariate regression analysis was employed in the training set to recognize features. The primary purpose of the training set was to construct models, while the test set was reserved exclusively for assessing the models’ predictive capabilities.

Patients with HAP require antibiotic therapy and invasive procedures (4) and are predisposed to developing infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (5, 6). In cases of infections with MDROs, the complexity of treatment and management for patients in neuro-intensive care units (NICUs) with HAP is significantly increased (7), resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, heightened economic burdens for patients and their families, and a heightened risk of in-hospital mortality (8, 9). Therefore, it may be beneficial to utilize machine learning (ML) models for prediction, identification, and application of targeted interventions to reduce the incidence of infections with MDRO among neurocritical care patients with HAP.

Local antibiograms provide information on the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens specific to a healthcare facility or unit, such as the ICU or NICU. This data helps clinicians tailor empiric therapy to target the most likely pathogens and their resistance profiles, thereby improving treatment efficacy and reducing the risk of selecting inappropriate antibiotics.

       "    'retrieved_contexts': ['Notably, for neurocritical care patients, strict glycemic control had no effect on patient mortality but increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (44). According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of optimal glycemic control in neurocritical care patients, a more conservative approach is the most appropriate (i.e., maintaining blood glucose levels of 110 mg/dL–180 mg/dL) (45). The variety of antibiotics used during the hospitalization of patients with HAP in the NICU was strongly associated with infections with MDROs. In NICU settings, patients with HAP commonly experience aspiration and impaired immune function. Moreover, the empirical use of antibiotics, which is routinely advocated for patients with HAP, inevitably leads to increases in both the variety and duration of antibiotic administration (46). Combined use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure on the patient’s microbial population, fostering the emergence of resistant strains (47). Therefore, stringent adherence to drug indications is paramount (48). Expediting the selection of appropriate antibiotics necessitates the prompt and accurate profiling of antibiotic susceptibility testing (49). Given the approximately 24 h turnaround time for standard antibiotic susceptibility testing following bacterial identification (50, 51), clinicians can turn to ML models to predict antimicrobial resistance in MDROs, which can shorten the delay in obtaining susceptibility testing results from microbiology laboratories (52). A longer ICU stay was associated with an increased risk of infections with MDROs in the NICU. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that ICU admission itself poses a significant risk for MDRO infections (53, 54). More importantly, patients in the NICU primarily include individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, acute cerebrovascular disorder, severe central nervous system infection, persistent seizure episodes, and emergent post-neurosurgical care (55). Patients with low immunity are more prone to infections with MDRO. To mitigate this risk of infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP, clinical staff should prioritize measures to expedite patient transfer to general wards, as these environments typically exhibit lower levels of bacterial resistance and invasiveness than ICUs do (56).',\n",

Higher scores indicate greater deviation from normal ranges. Severity was categorized as low (score 0–2), moderate (score 3–5), high (score 6-7), or critical (≥ 8). Kidney function was categorized as “normal,” “abnormal,” or “known abnormal” based on serum creatinine levels. Abnormal kidney function was defined by serum creatinine levels exceeding the upper limit of normal according to laboratory reference ranges (> 106 μmol/L in males and > 97 μmol/L in females). Known abnormal kidney function included patients with a prior diagnosis of chronic kidney disease or those who were discharged from their initial admission with abnormal creatinine levels that persisted until their second admission. For hospital readmissions, data collection included the primary causes of readmission (categorized as respiratory, cardiovascular, infectious, renal, or other), presenting symptoms, patient disposition, radiological findings, urea and creatinine levels, and respiratory support requirements. Respiratory support was classified into five levels: no oxygen, low-flow oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation. Additional data included ICU admission status, length of ICU and hospital stay, and outcomes (discharged home, mortality, or transfer). The NEWS2 was also recalculated at readmission to assess the severity of the patient's condition. To maintain data accuracy, a random sample of 10% of patient charts underwent independent review by two research assistants. Inter-rater reliability was measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient, with values exceeding 0.8 for all key variables.

A history of thromboembolic disease was noted in 12 patients (6%) (Table 1). Persistent COVID-19 pneumonia (defined as ongoing COVID-19 compatible symptoms with hypoxia not attributable to other conditions) was the most common reason for readmission, present in 105 patients (52.5%). Other documented reasons included urinary tract infections (UTIs) (23 patients, 11.5%), bacterial pneumonia (1 patient, 0.5%), and acute kidney function deterioration (15 patients, 7.5%). Additionally, 14 patients with chronic kidney disease experienced worsening renal function compared to their status at discharge. Other reasons for readmission included pulmonary edema or fluid overload (13 patients, 6.5%), new ischemic cardiac events—two cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and three cases of non-STEMI—one cardiac arrest event, new-onset atrial fibrillation (18 patients, 9%), thromboembolic events (7 patients; 5 pulmonary embolism and 2 deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), and stroke (3 patients, 1.5%).

       "     'The value of carbamide, which has been rarely reported in previous studies, was identified as an independent risk factor for infections with MDRO in our study. Carbamide, the primary end product of amino acid metabolism (34), is linked to kidney function and is also influenced by protein breakdown or intake (35). Carbamide levels may increase in individuals enduring acute infectious diseases, profound fevers, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, severe trauma, extensive surgery, and hyperthyroidism and in those on high-protein diets or receiving oral steroid hormone administration (36). Neurocritical care individuals, due to the intense physiological strain coupled with resultant glucocorticoid upregulation, frequently experience elevated rates of protein decomposition, resulting in diminished immune competence and amplified susceptibility to infection (37). Therefore, our findings indicate the importance of maintaining nitrogen balance in patients in the NICU. Timely and effective nutritional therapy is essential for critically ill neurological patients (38). For patients with acute catabolic states and other common pathophysiological features of severe brain injury, nutritional therapy should be initiated as early as possible, preferably within the first 24 h (39). Clinical staff can employ indirect calorimetry to accurately determine the energy requirements of patients, and for those at elevated nutritional risk who are incapable of meeting their requirements orally, early enteral nutrition within 24–48 h after admission is recommended (40). In our study, diabetes was a significant independent predictor of infections with MDROs among patients with HAP admitted to the NICU. This association can be attributed to the fact that uncontrolled hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes impairs overall immunity through various mechanistic pathways, thereby heightening the risk of infections (41, 42). Clinical staff should regularly monitor and evaluate the blood glucose levels of patients in the NICU with HAP (43). Notably, for neurocritical care patients, strict glycemic control had no effect on patient mortality but increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (44).',\n",

The 30-day readmission rate ranges from 4% to as high as 11.3%. The causes of readmission after a COVID-19 admission are diverse and include persistent respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, secondary bacterial infection, and thromboembolic disease. This study aims to describe the causes of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge following an acute COVID-19 infection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March 2020 and February 2022 and included all adult patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after a primary hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 3517 patients were hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection during the study period, and 200 patients were rehospitalized within 30 days postdischarge, resulting in a readmission rate of 5.7%. The mean age of the readmitted patients was 66.35 ± 19.5 years, and 105 (52.5%) were male. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. Chronic respiratory disease was present in 44 patients (22%) prior to their acute COVID-19 infection. The mean time to readmission was 7.86 ± 5.8 days. Persistent COVID-19 pneumonia was the most common cause of readmission, diagnosed in 105 patients (52.5%), followed by renal impairment in 29 patients (14.5%). Urinary tract infections were the leading infectious cause of readmission, occurring in 23 patients (11.5%), while secondary bacterial pneumonia was rare. Shortness of breath and cough were the most common symptoms at the second presentation. Respiratory therapeutic interventions were required for 120 patients (60%), and 45 patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission.',\n",
       "     'Hospital readmission following discharge is a critical indicator for evaluating healthcare delivery quality and efficiency. This observational study found a readmission rate of 5.7%, consistent with international findings reported in similar COVID-19 cohorts. Most readmissions occurred relatively early, with a mean interval of approximately 7.5 days postdischarge, aligning closely with prior studies that reported readmissions typically within 5–7 days [2, 18, 19]. Higher readmission rates have been documented among specific subgroups, notably individuals aged over 80 years [1, 16, 19, 20]. The observed similarity between our findings and those from other regions of Saudi Arabia suggests a possible national trend [10]. Persistent COVID-19 pneumonia was the primary cause of readmission in over half of the patients (52.5%), exceeding figures reported in other studies (approximately 30%) [21], although comparable to higher estimates (68.8%) observed elsewhere [2]. Interestingly, only 22% of our cohort had preexisting respiratory conditions, suggesting ongoing COVID-19-related lung involvement rather than exacerbation of chronic lung disease as the predominant driver of readmissions. Acute kidney injury and UTIs represented other leading causes of readmission. The occurrence of acute renal impairment upon readmission (14.5%) was within the wide range (0.5%–46%) documented globally, with geographical variability likely reflecting differences in healthcare practices, patient demographics, and possibly circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants [5, 22–24]. Although UTIs are a common admission reason in Saudi Arabia independent of COVID-19, recent studies suggest a potential pathophysiological link through ACE-2 receptor expression in the urinary tract, thus possibly connecting UTI occurrence directly with SARS-CoV-2 infection [25–27]. DVT occurred at a substantially lower rate (0.1%) compared to previously reported rates (up to 12%) [28]. This discrepancy may be attributable to population-specific characteristics, adherence to thromboprophylaxis protocols, or variations in reporting standards across studies. Our findings also indicated a notable increase in ICU admissions and invasive respiratory support requirements upon readmission.',\n",
       "     \"Patients under the age of 18 years, as well as pregnant females with a confirmed COVID-19 test who were scheduled for follow-up appointments, were excluded from the study. Several challenges were encountered with specific files. For instance, some patients chose to discharge themselves against medical advice early during readmission, which limited the collection of key variables. Additionally, the National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) depends on specific parameters that are critical for the study's accuracy and completeness; therefore, patients with missing or incomplete parameters were excluded. Moreover, certain values were unavailable in physician notes. However, this issue was mitigated by cross-referencing nursing notes to ensure data completeness and reliability. Despite these challenges, careful efforts were made to minimize data gaps and maintain the integrity of the study. Data were manually extracted from electronic patient medical records using the BestCare system by a team of six trained research assistants under the supervision of the principal investigator. To ensure consistency and accuracy, a standardized electronic data collection form was developed. The extracted variables for primary admissions included patient demographics (age, sex, and BMI), comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and immunosuppression), symptoms at presentation (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and fatigue), and vital signs upon admission (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and consciousness level), Laboratory investigations encompassed urea and creatinine levels. Additionally, data on antibiotics or antivirals administered for COVID-19 and radiological findings from chest X-rays (presence or absence of infiltrates, unilateral or bilateral infiltrate distribution, and pleural effusion) were collected. The severity of COVID-19 infection at both admission and discharge was assessed using the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2). This standardized tool, developed by the Royal College of Physicians in 2012, is designed to detect and respond to clinical deterioration in adult patients. NEWS2 assigns scores to routinely measure physiological parameters, including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and consciousness level.\",\n",
       "     'This discrepancy may be attributable to population-specific characteristics, adherence to thromboprophylaxis protocols, or variations in reporting standards across studies. Our findings also indicated a notable increase in ICU admissions and invasive respiratory support requirements upon readmission. This may reflect the progression of COVID-19-related respiratory disease or an increased risk of associated complications, such as secondary pneumonia or heart failure. Reported ICU admission rates and invasive ventilation requirements in the literature vary significantly (7%–60%), reflecting the diverse clinical severity, patient demographics, and follow-up durations across different studies [21, 29, 30]. The observed mortality rate during readmissions was substantial (12.5%), with respiratory failure and sepsis being the most common underlying causes. These findings closely match other international reports, documenting postdischarge mortality ranging between 7.2% and 17.9% within 30 days after initial hospitalization [20]. The 1-year postdischarge all-cause mortality rate is estimated at 7.87%, with most deaths occurring within the first 30 days after discharge [31]. The relatively high mortality observed among our readmitted patients likely stems from multiple factors: underlying comorbidities, the severity of initial infection, and potentially premature discharges related to healthcare system constraints during the pandemic. The NEWS2 has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic as a sensitive tool for severity assessment and to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration [17, 32, 33]. Notably, a large proportion of patients discharged (83%) had moderate to critical NEWS2, raising concerns about the criteria used for discharge decision-making. Literature has identified low NEWS2 at discharge as protective against readmissions [34]; thus, higher scores observed in our patients warrant further investigation into discharge planning practices at our facility. While NEWS2 scoring systems are not currently standardized for discharge decision-making regarding COVID-19, this study highlights their potential utility. Furthermore, exploring additional biomarkers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at discharge could further enhance risk stratification and potentially reduce readmission rates through more targeted postdischarge follow-up or delayed discharge for high-risk patients [35].',\n",

The distribution according to geographic region did not significantly differ between genotypes VII and VI (P = 0.912). Additionally, hospitalization rates were similar between genotypes VI (76.5%) and VII (100%), with no statistically significant difference (P = 1.000) (Table 5). Bivariate analysis comparing the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pertussis cases among circulating genotypes in Peru from 2018 to 2019 (n = 63) Calculated by Fisher’s exact test. B. pertussis is a challenging microorganism to isolate because various factors affect its viability, including the timely collection and transportation of samples, specialized culture requirements, and whether the patient was vaccinated or received antibiotics against pertussis (22). Current typing methods rely on pathogen isolation, which has restricted understanding of genotypic diversity in our country. In this study, we detected genotypic variants of B. pertussis circulating in Peru between 2018 and 2019 using an alternative isolation-free typing method based on the sequencing of vaccine antigen genes (ptxP, ptxA, fim3, and prn) directly from nasopharyngeal swab samples. We detected the allelic variants ptxA1 and ptxP3 in all the clinical samples analyzed for the ptxA (96/96) and ptxP (83/83) genes, respectively (Fig. 2). Among the 11 allelic variants of ptxP (ptxP1 to ptxP11), ptxP3 is prevalent worldwide (17, 23). These two allelic variants (ptxA1 and ptxP3) have been reported in the United States (24), Mexico (25), Argentina (26), Australia (27), China (28), Japan (29), South Africa (30), and various European countries, including Italy, France, Spain, and Belgium (5).'],\n",

Outcomes assessed included overall and ICU length of stay (LOS), pneumonia severity index (PSI) score on admission, in-hospital mortality, and need for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as well as supplemental oxygen during admission. Analyses for outcomes were completed by biological sex, sex and age, age within the same sex groups, and sex and primary admission diagnosis. For patients who were alive at discharge, charts were reviewed for the need for supplemental oxygen and ventilation on discharge. All data were obtained from the Epic Systems (Verona, Wisconsin) EMR retrospectively. Data collection included patient clinical data, laboratory and imaging results, and clinician notes where necessary for determining whether cultures met the inclusion criteria. All chart reviews were completed by trained medical staff. Data were stored using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data management platform (31, 32). Demographic and risk factor characteristics were assessed for differences by biological sex using the Pearson χ test. Continuous variables, including outcome data, were analyzed using a parametric Student t-test or non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, respectively. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was then performed for select outcomes using covariates including biological sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking within 30 days prior to admission, alcohol use within 30 days prior to admission, congestive heart failure status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status.

       "     'Notably, for neurocritical care patients, strict glycemic control had no effect on patient mortality but increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (44). According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of optimal glycemic control in neurocritical care patients, a more conservative approach is the most appropriate (i.e., maintaining blood glucose levels of 110 mg/dL–180 mg/dL) (45). The variety of antibiotics used during the hospitalization of patients with HAP in the NICU was strongly associated with infections with MDROs. In NICU settings, patients with HAP commonly experience aspiration and impaired immune function. Moreover, the empirical use of antibiotics, which is routinely advocated for patients with HAP, inevitably leads to increases in both the variety and duration of antibiotic administration (46). Combined use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure on the patient’s microbial population, fostering the emergence of resistant strains (47). Therefore, stringent adherence to drug indications is paramount (48). Expediting the selection of appropriate antibiotics necessitates the prompt and accurate profiling of antibiotic susceptibility testing (49). Given the approximately 24 h turnaround time for standard antibiotic susceptibility testing following bacterial identification (50, 51), clinicians can turn to ML models to predict antimicrobial resistance in MDROs, which can shorten the delay in obtaining susceptibility testing results from microbiology laboratories (52). A longer ICU stay was associated with an increased risk of infections with MDROs in the NICU. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that ICU admission itself poses a significant risk for MDRO infections (53, 54). More importantly, patients in the NICU primarily include individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, acute cerebrovascular disorder, severe central nervous system infection, persistent seizure episodes, and emergent post-neurosurgical care (55). Patients with low immunity are more prone to infections with MDRO. To mitigate this risk of infections with MDROs among NICU patients with HAP, clinical staff should prioritize measures to expedite patient transfer to general wards, as these environments typically exhibit lower levels of bacterial resistance and invasiveness than ICUs do (56).',\n",

Males older than 50 were also more likely to require supplemental oxygen (40% vs 21%, P = 0.016) and ventilation (19% vs 7%, P = 0.046) on discharge than males 18–50 years. By type of oxygen received on discharge, males older than 50 years were more likely to receive invasive ventilation than males 18–50 (35% vs 17%, P = 0.021) years, and females older than 50 years were more likely to receive low-flow oxygen than females 18–50 (13% vs 0%, P = 0.041) years.

       "     'To avoid double counting, only the first isolate was recorded for each patient according to their ID number, which may lead to a potential risk of bias. In this retrospective study, some potentially meaningful predictors, such as C-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, and whether the patient had experienced aspiration, were not assessed due to the lack of data. The predictor of length of NICU stay in this study exhibits a lag, necessitating future clinical research to explore earlier predictive indicators for identifying high-risk patients. In conclusion, the prediction model using the logistic regression method had a better predictive effect than the four other ML methods. Length of NICU stay, number of antibiotics used, diabetes, and the carbamide value were predictors of infections with MDROs for neurocritical care patients with HAP. Based on these predictors, we built a prediction nomogram for the detection of infections with MDROs. For each patient, a higher total point score reflected a greater risk of infection with MDROs. Overall, our study will help in the prediction and implementation of targeted interventions against infections with MDROs among patients with HAP who were admitted to the NICU for better patient management.'],\n",

       "     'Title: Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Readmitted Adult Patients With Acute COVID-19 Infection Within 30 Days of Their Hospital Discharge\\n\\nAbstract: Introduction: Readmission to the hospital after an acute COVID-19 infection varies in the literature in terms of rate, causes, and outcomes. The 30-day readmission rate ranges from 4% to as high as 11.3%. The causes of readmission after a COVID-19 admission are diverse and include persistent respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, secondary bacterial infection, and thromboembolic disease. This study aims to describe the causes of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge following an acute COVID-19 infection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March 2020 and February 2022 and included all adult patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after a primary hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 3517 patients were hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection during the study period, and 200 patients were rehospitalized within 30 days postdischarge, resulting in a readmission rate of 5.7%. The mean age of the readmitted patients was 66.35 ± 19.5 years, and 105 (52.5%) were male. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. Chronic respiratory disease was present in 44 patients (22%) prior to their acute COVID-19 infection. The mean time to readmission was 7.86 ± 5.8 days. Persistent COVID-19 pneumonia was the most common cause of readmission, diagnosed in 105 patients (52.5%), followed by renal impairment in 29 patients (14.5%). Urinary tract infections were the leading infectious cause of readmission, occurring in 23 patients (11.5%), while secondary bacterial pneumonia was rare. Shortness of breath and cough were the most common symptoms at the second presentation. Respiratory therapeutic interventions were required for 120 patients (60%), and 45 patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission.',\n",
       "     \"The rate and causes of hospital readmission following an acute COVID-19 infection vary depending on the definition of readmission used, geographical location, patient characteristics, and the timing of the study relative to the pandemic's onset. For example, in China, the 30-day postdischarge readmission rate was reported to be less than 8.8% [9], while one center in northern Saudi Arabia reported a rate of 5.9% [10]. Similarly, studies in the USA have shown a readmission rate of around 6.4% [11]. Notably, a higher readmission rate of 11.3% has been observed among individuals aged 80 years and older [1]. Identified risk factors for readmission include preexisting respiratory disease, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, advanced age, elevated creatinine levels at discharge, cancer, high body mass index (BMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among others [2, 10, 12–16]. In the current study, we investigated the rate and causes of hospital readmission within 30 days following an initial COVID-19 admission. Specifically, we analyzed the most common causes for readmission and explored whether comorbidities were associated with a more severe disease course requiring a second hospitalization. Additionally, we assessed the clinical presentation, hospital course, length of stay, and mortality during the second admission. This retrospective chart review included all adult readmissions at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) within 30 days of a primary admission for COVID-19 infection between March 2020 and February 2022. KAMC, located in Riyadh, is a major tertiary care center with a total bed capacity exceeding 2000 and played a critical role in managing COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic. The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older, with a primary admission due to acute respiratory COVID-19 infection, confirmed by at least one positive COVID-19 PCR result from a respiratory sample, and subsequent readmission within 30 days of discharge.\",\n",
       "     'This discrepancy may be attributable to population-specific characteristics, adherence to thromboprophylaxis protocols, or variations in reporting standards across studies. Our findings also indicated a notable increase in ICU admissions and invasive respiratory support requirements upon readmission. This may reflect the progression of COVID-19-related respiratory disease or an increased risk of associated complications, such as secondary pneumonia or heart failure. Reported ICU admission rates and invasive ventilation requirements in the literature vary significantly (7%–60%), reflecting the diverse clinical severity, patient demographics, and follow-up durations across different studies [21, 29, 30]. The observed mortality rate during readmissions was substantial (12.5%), with respiratory failure and sepsis being the most common underlying causes. These findings closely match other international reports, documenting postdischarge mortality ranging between 7.2% and 17.9% within 30 days after initial hospitalization [20]. The 1-year postdischarge all-cause mortality rate is estimated at 7.87%, with most deaths occurring within the first 30 days after discharge [31]. The relatively high mortality observed among our readmitted patients likely stems from multiple factors: underlying comorbidities, the severity of initial infection, and potentially premature discharges related to healthcare system constraints during the pandemic. The NEWS2 has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic as a sensitive tool for severity assessment and to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration [17, 32, 33]. Notably, a large proportion of patients discharged (83%) had moderate to critical NEWS2, raising concerns about the criteria used for discharge decision-making. Literature has identified low NEWS2 at discharge as protective against readmissions [34]; thus, higher scores observed in our patients warrant further investigation into discharge planning practices at our facility. While NEWS2 scoring systems are not currently standardized for discharge decision-making regarding COVID-19, this study highlights their potential utility. Furthermore, exploring additional biomarkers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at discharge could further enhance risk stratification and potentially reduce readmission rates through more targeted postdischarge follow-up or delayed discharge for high-risk patients [35].',\n",
       "     \"Shortness of breath and cough were the most common symptoms at the second presentation. Respiratory therapeutic interventions were required for 120 patients (60%), and 45 patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Compared to the index admission, a higher proportion of patients required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. After the index admission, most patients were still symptomatic at discharge (moderate to critical National Early Warning Scores (NEWS)). Conclusion: The readmission rate after acute COVID-19 infection was 5.7%, aligning with rates reported internationally. The most frequent causes of readmission were persistent COVID-19 pneumonia, renal impairment, and urinary tract infections, while secondary bacterial pneumonia at readmission was rare. Readmission was associated with increased rates of ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation. The use of NEWS at discharge may serve as a useful criterion for determining readiness for discharge. Future follow-up of this cohort of patients will determine chronic long-term respiratory complications.\\n\\nFull Text: The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most significant health crises of the 21st century. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. Since then, countries worldwide have faced substantial health and economic consequences. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) predominantly affects the respiratory tract, with acute pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being among the most severe complications [2]. Both acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19 infection have been reported, including an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, bowel ischemia, severe ileus, acute ischemic stroke, acute liver and kidney injury, and arrhythmias, among many others [3–8].
